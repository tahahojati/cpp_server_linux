Ok we want to do process management, threading, memory.
// read and write to file. 
// several classes
// member initializer lists
// abstract classes
// composition 
// thread pooling
// templates
// promise future
// mutex
// condition_variable


// Ok the server will have to accept multiple requests. each of which has to take a bunch of time
// we have to store some data. 
// in order to have true concurrency, we have to have another worker thread.
// perhaps the database can run on a different thread. and we can have multiple databases.
